==================

From Epicodus Week 2 Day 3 - an expense tracker using JS objects and jQuery

* Make a web page to track your expenses. To start off with, just make a form where users can input a description and amount for each purchase, and list out all the purchases:

* Make a prototype called Purchase to create objects for the purchases. It's always a good idea to pick out names for prototypes that closely match the real-world language we use to talk about them.

* An expense tracker isn't very useful if you can't categorize your purchases. Make a form where users can create new categories. When users picks a category, it lists all the purchases in the category, and has a place to add new purchases:

* You should make a prototype called Category for this feature.

* Our users should be able to easily see where they're spending their money. Let's add a chart to the page displaying the amount and percentage the user has spent in each category:
